Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.


With Expo tools, services, and React, you can build, deploy, and quickly iterate on native Android, iOS, and web apps from the same JavaScript codebase.

- Access to device capabilities like camera, location, notifications, sensors, haptics, and much more, all with universal APIs.

- Build service gives you app-store ready binaries and handles certificates, no need for you to touch Xcode or Android Studio.

- Over-the-air updates let you update your app at any time without the hassle and delays of submitting to the store.

## Quick Start

If you are already experienced with React and JavaScript tooling and want to dive right in and figure things out as you go, this is the quickest way to get started:

```
$ npm install -g expo-cli
$ expo init my-project
$ cd my-project
$ expo start
```
